# flipper-android
Simple flipping text control.

The project is based on https://github.com/Vinayrraj/Android-FlipDigitView (the one isn't supported/updated for years) with a bunch of improvements and bug fixes:
- countdown made possible;
- flipper segments became views with custom layout and text drawn, not just static images;
- custom sets of flipping texts can be applied, not just a sequence of 10 chars, 0 to 9 (see the example).
